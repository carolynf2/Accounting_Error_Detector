## 📊 Sample Output

### Error Detection Results
```
⚠️  Found 8 errors in Entry JE-2024-0125:

1. 🔴 UNBALANCED_ENTRY (HIGH)
   Entry is out of balance by $150.00. Debits: $2,350.00, Credits: $2,200.00
   💡 Suggestion: Add credit of $150.00 or reduce debits by $150.00

2. 🟡 UNUSUAL_AMOUNT (MEDIUM)  
   Line 2 amount $25,000.00 is unusually large (threshold: $8,542.33)
   💡 Suggestion: Verify amount is correct - may need additional approval

3. 🟢 MISSING_DESCRIPTION (LOW)
   Line 3 is missing description
   💡 Suggestion: Add description to clarify this line item
```

### Correction Suggestions
```
--- Correction Suggestions ---

Unbalanced Entry:
  1. Add credit to Cash account: $150.00
  2. Add credit to Accounts Payable: $150.00  
  3. Reduce existing debit by: $150.00

Account Type Mismatch:
  1. Consider using 5100 - Wages Expense instead of 1100
  2. Consider using 5200 - Rent Expense instead of 1100
